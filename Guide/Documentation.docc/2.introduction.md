Storage: 64GB 
Processor: 4GB RAM

Program files, data files would be store in physical storage. 

How app program runs on tapping the app 
    - program files (instruction) will be brought into the main memory 
    - cpu will start exectuing the instruction
    - when app access some other file (data) from physical storage, that data also should be brought into main memory  
    - datastructurs helps to arriange these data in the main memory for effiecent execution  

## Database 

    - arrianging the data in some format called data base  
    - HDD Storage - orgainzed data | relational data (cpomm) 
    - table, data may be spread across varias tables and there will be a relationship between tables. 
    - when app uses those data, that should be brough into the main memory 

## Datawharehouse  
    - operation data, a data which used daily where as 
    - legacy data (old data) | historical data kept under datawharehouse 
    
## Big Data
    - analysing large amount of data to take some decision 
    - study about storaging analying large amount of data is bigdata 
        
    
## Static vs Dynamic Memory

    - every byte will have its own adress 
    - address would be a liner values   
    - if the byte starting from 0 to 65535 - then the size of the main memory would be 64KB
    - 64 * 1024 = 64 KB   
    - in computer or in mobile, 8GB of RAM memory would be chunked as segments, not as entire 8GB.
    - 1 segment of main memory is 64KB
    - Int can take 2 bytes of 4 bytes. it depends on the compiler 
    - in a program, whatever the variables we declare, would be allocated in the stack
    
## Stack 
    - its organized memory 
    - memory allocation for function and variable would be done in stack
    - for variable declaration, pointers allocated in stack   
    
## Heap 
    - Piling up or tower like structure  
    - organized heap or unorganized heap  
    - should be used as resource, can be used whenever free and should be released once done 
    - program cant access heap memory directly 
    - can be accessed only by pointer
    - upon initializing the variable, then memory will be allocated in heap (new instance, malloc etc)
    - if allocated memory not deallocated, that might cause the memory leak 
    
    ```swift
        
       var k = [Int]() - This needs two bytes, and would be allocated in stack  
       
       k = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6] - This needs 10bytes, but this would be allocated in heap 
       
       Now variable k, which allocated in stack, would point the heap   
    ``` 

## Physical Datastructure 
    This ds decides, how the memory is organized, or how the data is stored 
    ### Array        
    - array - collection of contigious memory 
    - array can be created either in stack or in heap
    - if we know the size of the list, the can be chosen fixed array  
    ### Linked list
    - dynamic data structure, collection of nodes, each nodes contains the address of the next nodes
    - linked list always created in a heap 

## Logical Datastructure 
    - How the operation gonna be done on the phyical datastrucure
    - How we gonna utilize those data on the datasturcures 
    - to implement logical datastructure, we would use any one or any combination of physical datastructure   
    
    ### linear datastructure
    - Stack  (lifo)
    - Queues (fifo)
    
    ### non-linear datastructures 
    - Trees
    - Graph 
    
    ### tabular
    - Hash Table      
    
    
## Time & Space Complexity

    - How much time & space a machine takes to do a task. 

## Recurssion 
    - Process happens like a tree
    - Head recurssion, tail recurssion, indirect recurssion, nested recurssion   
    - Time Complexity - O(2^n)
    - Space complexity - O(n)
