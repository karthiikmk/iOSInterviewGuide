### Summay
 
Merge two sorted arrays 
- Create new array
- iterate both the arrays, insert the elements by checking 
- inserte remaining elements 

Find Missing element  
- [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14]
- Consider the first element as the differentiator 
- Iterate over each element and see (element - index) == differentiator 
- if not matching then, that index + differentiator was missing 

Find Duplicates in sorted array 
- [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]
- 1. Use hashtable to keep track of the elements count
- 2. use for and while to iterate inner for every index to find the duplicates

Remove kth element (k wil be provided)
- use start and endIndex 
- swap the start to endIndex if its its matches 
- reduce the endIndex by 1 

Remove element in sorted array (in place)
- as its sorted, look for first and next, if its matches mark the seonc one as 

Find / Remove Duplicate 
- [p,w,w,k,e,w] - lengthOfLongestSubstring 
- use fast and slow pointers from the start
- [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5] - remove duplicates
- or we can make use of stack 

Sorted Squares 
- Creating new array
- Poiting writeIndex at the endIndex of the new array
- Inserting larger values in the k, and keep reducing it.
