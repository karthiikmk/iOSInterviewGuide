 If you want to learn Design Patterns and LLD, just watch these 11 Videos:

 These are the most important design Patterns that one can be asked during an interview.

 Singleton Design Pattern (Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it): https://lnkd.in/gh5uFq5p

 Factory Design Pattern (Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created): https://lnkd.in/ghqAbVuW

 Composite Design Pattern (Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies): https://lnkd.in/gDuW9BqP

 Builder Design Pattern (Use for Building immutable Objects): https://lnkd.in/gdgRrZSR

 State Design Pattern (Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes): https://lnkd.in/g4ez-Ubn

 Observer Design Pattern (Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically): https://lnkd.in/gKucwt-e

 Iterator Design Pattern (Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation): https://lnkd.in/gcPB_N6V

 Adapter Design Pattern (Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect): https://lnkd.in/gTg_fBy8

 Strategy Design Pattern (Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable): https://lnkd.in/gk9JUmYc

 Abstract Design Pattern (Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes): https://lnkd.in/gvQ2Jhhm

 Prototype Design Pattern (Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype): https://lnkd.in/gFkBv7we

 Bonus: GitHub Repo that has Code examples of above Design Patterns: https://lnkd.in/gr8mr-J8
