/// A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
/// The structure of a binary tree allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
/// In a binary tree, there are no specific rules or constraints on the arrangement of nodes. Nodes can be inserted in any order, and the tree might not necessarily be sorted.
///
/// Time Complexity:
/// Search: O(n)
/// Insertion: O(n)
/// Deletion: O(n)
/// Storage Complexity: O(n)
