 SOLID PRINICIPLES
 
Single Responsibility Principle
 
 1. A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.
 2. This makes your code more modular and easier to maintain.
 3. Keep each class focused on a single task to improve readability, maintainability, and reusability.
 - Eg: DataFetcher, DataDisplayer etc
 
Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
 
 - The code open for extension but closed for modification
 - OCP by allowing you to extend the system's functionality without altering existing code
 - we can use protocols and create extensions for each class
 - Eg: DataManager which processes the data of diff type like file, database, api etc
 
 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
 
 - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
 - Ensure derived classes preserve the behavior of the base class, not break it.
  
 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
 - A class should not be forced to implement methods it doesnâ€™t use.
 - Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific interfaces tailored to different client needs.
 
 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
 
 - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
 - Use interfaces or abstractions to reduce coupling between components and make the system more flexible.
